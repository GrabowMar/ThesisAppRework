# Migration from JSON to Database Storage

## Overview
Successfully migrated the application from using JSON files for configuration data to using database storage. This improves data consistency, enables better querying capabilities, and eliminates the need for file-based data loading.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ModelIntegrationService (`src/core_services.py`)
**Before:** Loaded data from JSON files (`port_config.json`, `model_capabilities.json`, `models_summary.json`)
**After:** Loads data directly from database tables (`ModelCapability`, `PortConfiguration`)

Key changes:
- Replaced JSON file loading with database queries
- Generate models summary dynamically from database data
- Added database context handling for Flask app integration
- Maintained the same interface for compatibility

### 2. Updated Application Factory (`src/app.py`)
**Before:** 
```python
# Load from JSON files
with open(capabilities_file) as f:
    capabilities_data = json.load(f)
```

**After:**
```python
# Load from database
model_capabilities = ModelCapability.query.all()
for model in model_capabilities:
    # Process database records
```

Key changes:
- Replaced file I/O operations with database queries
- Added proper import handling for database models
- Generate configuration data on-the-fly from database
- Maintain same config structure for backward compatibility

### 3. Updated Service Manager (`src/service_manager.py`)
**Before:** Initialized ModelIntegrationService with file path
**After:** Initialized ModelIntegrationService with Flask app context for database access

### 4. Created Migration Utility (`src/migrate_to_database.py`)
- Provides automated migration from JSON files to database
- Handles data validation and error checking
- Supports force migration to overwrite existing data
- Includes verification of successful migration

## Database Models Used

### ModelCapability
Stores AI model information including:
- Basic info: `model_id`, `provider`, `model_name`
- Capabilities: `supports_vision`, `supports_function_calling`, etc.
- Pricing: `input_price_per_token`, `output_price_per_token`
- Performance: `cost_efficiency`, `safety_score`
- Extended data: JSON fields for additional capabilities and metadata

### PortConfiguration
Stores Docker port mappings including:
- `model`: Model identifier
- `app_num`: Application number
- `frontend_port`, `backend_port`: Port assignments
- `is_available`: Availability status
- `metadata_json`: Additional configuration data

## Benefits of Database Migration

1. **Data Consistency**: Single source of truth in database
2. **Performance**: Faster queries compared to parsing large JSON files
3. **Scalability**: Better handling of large datasets
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new fields and relationships
5. **Reliability**: ACID transactions ensure data integrity
6. **Querying**: SQL-based filtering and searching capabilities

## Backward Compatibility

The migration maintains full backward compatibility:
- Same configuration structure in Flask app config
- Same API interfaces for services
- Same data formats returned to application components
- Existing templates and routes work unchanged

## Testing Results

✅ Application starts successfully  
✅ Data loads from database (25 models, 750 port configurations)  
✅ Web interface accessible  
✅ All existing functionality preserved  

## Files Modified

- `src/core_services.py` - Updated ModelIntegrationService
- `src/app.py` - Updated data loading logic  
- `src/service_manager.py` - Updated service initialization
- `src/migrate_to_database.py` - New migration utility

## Files No Longer Required

The following JSON files are no longer loaded during application startup:
- `misc/model_capabilities.json` - Data now in `model_capabilities` table
- `misc/port_config.json` - Data now in `port_configurations` table  
- `misc/models_summary.json` - Generated dynamically from database

**Note**: These files can be kept as backups but are not used by the application.

## Future Enhancements

With database storage now in place, the following enhancements are possible:
1. Real-time model capability updates
2. Historical tracking of model changes
3. Advanced filtering and searching
4. Model usage analytics
5. Dynamic port allocation
6. Multi-user configuration management

## Verification Commands

To verify the migration:

```bash
# Check database contains data
cd src && python -c "
from app import create_app
from models import ModelCapability, PortConfiguration, db
app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    print(f'Models: {ModelCapability.query.count()}')
    print(f'Ports: {PortConfiguration.query.count()}')
"

# Test application startup
cd src && python app.py
```

Expected output:
- Models: 25
- Ports: 750
- Application should start and show "Loaded from database" messages
