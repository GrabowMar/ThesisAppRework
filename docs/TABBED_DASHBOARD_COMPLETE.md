## 📁 Files Modified

### **src/templates/pages/analysis/dashboard/app_detail.html**
- **Before:** 465 lines (simple single-page dashboard)
- **After:** 693 lines (6-tab interface)
- **Changes:**
  - Added tabbed navigation structure
  - Reorganized content into 6 tabs
  - Added Overview tab with summary cards and charts
  - Added category-specific tabs (Security, Performance, Quality)
  - Added 5 new JavaScript functions:
    - `populateOverviewTab()` - Overview metrics and top issues
    - `populateCategoryTabs()` - Call all category populators
    - `populateSecurityTab()` - Security findings + filter
    - `populatePerformanceTab()` - Performance findings
    - `populateQualityTab()` - Quality findings + filter
  - Kept all original features (CSV export, modal, sorting)

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Data Flow:**

1. **Page Load:**
   ```javascript
   loadAnalysisData()
   └─ fetch(`/analysis/api/tasks/${TASK_ID}/results.json`)
   └─ Parse findings + summary
   └─ Call 6 populate functions:
      ├─ updateSummaryCards()     // Top 4 cards
      ├─ populateFilters()        // Filter dropdowns
      ├─ renderFindings()         // All Findings tab
      ├─ renderToolsTable()       // Tools tab
      ├─ populateOverviewTab()    // Overview tab
      └─ populateCategoryTabs()   // Security/Perf/Quality tabs
   ```

2. **Tab Click:**
   - Bootstrap handles tab switching
   - Content already loaded (no AJAX needed)
   - Instant switching ⚡

3. **Filter Change:**
   - Event listener captures dropdown change
   - Re-renders table with filtered data
   - Updates count footer

4. **Row Click:**
   - Calls `showFindingDetails(index)`
   - Builds modal HTML with finding data
   - Shows Bootstrap modal

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Immediate:**
- [ ] **User Browser Testing** - Click Dashboard View button and test all tabs
- [ ] Verify summary cards show correct counts
- [ ] Test all filters work (6 filters across tabs)
- [ ] Test sorting by clicking column headers
- [ ] Test modal opens on row click
- [ ] Check browser console for errors (F12)

### **Future Phases:**
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Model Comparison Dashboard (compare all apps for one model)
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Tools Overview Dashboard (18 tools across all analyses)
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Cross-Model Comparison (compare multiple models)

## 💡 Design Decisions

### **Why Tabs?**
- User saw the existing task detail page with tabs (Overview, Security, Performance, etc.)
- User wanted similar organization for dashboard
- Tabs provide clear visual separation of concerns
- No more information overload on one page

### **Why Keep "All Findings" Tab?**
- Power users want the full sortable/filterable table
- Category tabs are for focused analysis
- All Findings tab is for deep investigation
- Gives users choice: simple (category tabs) or advanced (all findings)

### **Why Overview Tab First?**
- Executives want quick summary
- Developers want to know "what's broken"
- Overview answers: How many? How severe? Where to start?
- Sets context before drilling into categories

### **Why Modal Instead of Inline Expansion?**
- Keeps table clean and scannable
- Modal provides more space for details
- Can include code snippets without breaking layout
- Bootstrap modal is accessible (keyboard nav, focus trap)

---

  - 🔴 Critical/High: Red (`bg-danger`)
  - 🟡 Medium: Yellow (`bg-warning`)
