# Docker Operations Log Window - Implementation Summary

## Problem
When clicking "Build" or other Docker operations on application detail pages, there was no visual feedback about what Docker was doing. Users couldn't tell if the operation was running, what stage it was at, or see any build logs.

## Solution
Implemented a real-time log window that displays Docker operation output in a modal dialog.

## Components Added

### 1. Log Modal Template
**File**: `src/templates/pages/applications/partials/modals/container_logs_modal.html`

A full-screen modal dialog featuring:
- **Status Banner**: Shows operation status, elapsed time, and progress
- **Log Output Window**: Terminal-style display with syntax highlighting
- **Controls**: Auto-scroll toggle, copy, clear, download, and cancel buttons
- **Real-time Updates**: Shows live output as operations progress

### 2. JavaScript Log Handler
**File**: `src/static/js/container_logs.js`

Class-based implementation (`ContainerLogsModal`) that provides:
- **Real-time Log Display**: Appends output as it arrives
- **Status Management**: Updates status banner based on operation state
- **Timer**: Shows elapsed time during operations
- **Log Management**: Copy, clear, and download functionality
- **Operation Control**: Cancel button for long-running operations
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scrolls to show latest output

### 3. Updated Container Manager
**File**: `src/static/js/container_manager.js`

Modified all Docker operations to use the new log modal:
- `build()` - Build containers with cache
- `rebuild()` - Build containers without cache
- `start()` - Start containers
- `stop()` - Stop containers
- `restart()` - Restart containers

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User clicks a Docker operation button (e.g., "Build images")
2. Log modal opens immediately showing status
3. Operation starts and output streams to the modal
4. User sees real-time feedback (stdout, stderr, status updates)
5. When complete, modal shows success/failure with full logs
6. User can close modal or download logs for reference

### Technical Flow
```
[UI Button Click] 
    ↓
[ContainerManager.build()] 
    ↓
[ContainerLogsModal.startOperation()]
    ↓
[POST /api/app/{model}/{number}/build]
    ↓
[DockerManager.build_containers()]
    ↓
[Response with stdout/stderr]
    ↓
[ContainerLogsModal.displayResults()]
    ↓
[User sees formatted output in modal]
```

## Features

### Visual Feedback
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Elapsed time counter
- ✅ Color-coded log levels (info, warning, error, success)
- ✅ Sectioned output (build, start, status)
- ✅ Progress indicators

### Log Management
- ✅ Copy logs to clipboard
- ✅ Download logs as .log file
- ✅ Clear logs (when not running)
- ✅ Auto-scroll toggle
- ✅ Line count display

### Operation Control
- ✅ Cancel long-running operations
- ✅ Prevent modal close during operations
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- ✅ Graceful error handling

## Integration

### In Application Detail Page
Updated `src/templates/pages/applications/detail.html` to:
1. Include the container logs modal template
2. Load the `container_logs.js` script
3. Initialize the modal on page load

The modal is automatically available for all Docker operations on the application detail page.

## API Response Format

The log modal expects responses in this format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "build": {
    "stdout": "Step 1/5 : FROM node:16...",
    "stderr": "",
    "exit_code": 0
  },
  "up": {
    "stdout": "Creating container...",
    "stderr": "",
    "exit_code": 0
  },
  "status_summary": {
    "running": 2,
    "stopped": 0
  },
  "preflight": {
    "compose_file_exists": true,
    "docker_available": true
  }
}
```

The modal intelligently parses different response structures and displays them in organized sections.

## User Benefits

1. **Transparency**: See exactly what Docker is doing
2. **Confidence**: Know the operation is progressing
3. **Debugging**: Access full logs when operations fail
4. **Progress Tracking**: See elapsed time and stage information
5. **Control**: Cancel operations if needed
6. **Archival**: Download logs for later analysis

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- [ ] WebSocket-based streaming for true real-time output
- [ ] Progress bar based on detected build steps
- [ ] Log filtering/search functionality
- [ ] Color themes for log output
- [ ] Multiple operation queue
- [ ] Historical log viewer

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to any application detail page
2. Click "Build images" or other Docker buttons
3. Observe the modal opening with real-time feedback
4. Try the control buttons (copy, download, cancel)
5. Verify logs display correctly for success and error cases

## Files Modified

- ✅ `src/templates/pages/applications/detail.html` - Include modal and scripts
- ✅ `src/templates/pages/applications/partials/modals/container_logs_modal.html` - New modal template
- ✅ `src/static/js/container_logs.js` - New log handler module
- ✅ `src/static/js/container_manager.js` - Updated to use log modal

No backend changes were required - the existing API responses already provide the necessary data.
