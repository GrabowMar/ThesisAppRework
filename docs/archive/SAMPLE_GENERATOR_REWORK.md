# Sample Generator UI Rework - Summary

## Overview
Completely reworked the sample generation interface to provide a unified, streamlined experience for both individual and batch generation operations.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Unified Generation Interface**
   - **File**: `src/templates/pages/sample_generator/partials/generation_tab_new.html`
   - Combined individual and batch generation into a single, cohesive interface
   - Supports three selection modes for both templates and models:
     - **Single**: Select one item at a time (traditional dropdown)
     - **Multiple**: Select multiple items via checkboxes
     - **All**: Select all available items with one click
   
### 2. **Scaffolded Models Only**
   - Models list now filtered to only show models with scaffolded projects
   - API call uses `mode=scaffolded` parameter
   - Prevents confusion from showing models without project structure

### 3. **Modern Tabler Design**
   - Clean card-based layout following Tabler.io design system
   - Consistent icon usage throughout
   - Proper spacing and visual hierarchy
   - Responsive grid layout (col-xl-6 for main sections)

### 4. **Enhanced Features**
   
   #### Template Selection:
   - Mode switcher (Single/Multiple/All)
   - Dropdown selector for single mode
   - Checkbox list for multiple mode
   - Live preview of template content
   - Real-time selection count

   #### Model Selection:
   - Same mode switcher pattern as templates
   - Only shows scaffolded models (per requirement)
   - Visual indication of selected count
   - Toggle all functionality

   #### Generation Options:
   - Scope selection (Frontend/Backend/Tests)
   - Concurrent workers (1-10)
   - Timeout configuration (60-900 seconds)
   - Backup option toggle
   - Real-time generation summary

   #### Generation Summary:
   - Live calculation of:
     - Number of templates selected
     - Number of models selected
     - Total jobs (templates × models)
     - Estimated completion time
   - Smart button states (disabled when invalid selection)

   #### Active Generations:
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Status polling every 5 seconds
   - Progress bars for each active job
   - Auto-stop polling when no active generations

   #### Recent Generations:
   - Last 20 generation runs
   - Timestamp, template, model, status, duration
   - Quick access to view results

### 5. **New JavaScript Module**
   - **File**: `src/static/js/sample_generator_unified.js`
   - Clean, modern ES6 class-based architecture
   - Handles all unified generation UI logic
   - Key capabilities:
     - Template/model loading and rendering
     - Mode switching (single/multiple/all)
     - Selection state management
     - Real-time summary calculations
     - API communication
     - Status polling
     - Preview functionality
     - Generation initiation (single & batch)

### 6. **Batch Tab Simplified**
   - **File**: `src/templates/pages/sample_generator/partials/batch_tab.html`
   - Now shows information card directing users to Generation tab
   - Explains that batch operations are integrated into Generation tab
   - Maintains navigation consistency

### 7. **Scripts Integration**
   - **File**: `src/templates/pages/sample_generator/partials/scripts.html`
   - Loads new unified JS before legacy JS
   - Both modules coexist for smooth transition
   - Proper initialization on both DOMContentLoaded and HTMX swaps

```

### API Integration

The unified interface communicates with existing API endpoints:

- `GET /api/sample-gen/templates` - Load templates
- `GET /api/sample-gen/models?mode=scaffolded` - Load scaffolded models only
- `GET /api/sample-gen/templates/app/{app_num}.md` - Preview template content
- `POST /api/sample-gen/generate` - Single generation
- `POST /api/sample-gen/generate/batch` - Batch generation
- `GET /api/sample-gen/status` - Active generation status

### Data Flow

```

```

## Benefits

1. **Unified Experience**: No more confusion between individual and batch workflows
2. **Flexible Selection**: Three modes (Single/Multiple/All) support all use cases
3. **Better Visibility**: Real-time summary shows exactly what will be generated
4. **Scaffolded Models Only**: Prevents errors from selecting non-scaffolded models
5. **Modern UI**: Clean, consistent Tabler design with proper accessibility
6. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates on active generations
7. **Smart Validation**: Buttons disabled until valid selections made
8. **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes with proper grid layout

## Migration Notes

- Old generation_tab.html now includes the new unified interface
- Old batch_tab.html redirects users to unified Generation tab
- Legacy sample_generator.js still loaded for compatibility with other tabs
- New sample_generator_unified.js handles all Generation tab logic
- Both modules designed to coexist without conflicts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Allow users to prioritize generation order
2. **Saved Configurations**: Save common template/model combinations
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter templates/models by provider, complexity, etc.
4. **Detailed Preview**: Show full template content in modal
5. **Generation History**: Persistent storage of all generation runs
6. **Notifications**: Browser notifications when batch completes
7. **Export Plans**: Export generation configuration as JSON for CLI use
8. **Resume Failed Jobs**: Automatically retry failed generations
9. **Resource Estimation**: Show estimated API cost and resource usage
10. **Scheduling**: Queue generations for later execution
