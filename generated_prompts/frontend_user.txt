# Generate Frontend: Todo App

**IMPORTANT: Generate the complete code immediately. Do not ask for confirmation or clarification. Output the full App.jsx code block directly.**

A simple todo application

## App Requirements

### User Features

### Admin Features
- Manage users

## Backend API Context

The backend has been generated with these endpoints:

Backend API Context Placeholder

## Access Control Rules

**CRITICAL - Implement conditional rendering:**

1. **Public View (not logged in)**:
   - HomePage shows ALL data in read-only mode
   - No edit/delete buttons visible
   - Show "Sign in to create/edit" call-to-action banners
   - Fetch data from public GET endpoints (no auth needed)

2. **Authenticated View (logged in)**:
   - Same data as public view
   - PLUS create/edit/delete buttons visible
   - PLUS forms for adding/editing items
   - Use `isAuthenticated` from useAuth() for conditional rendering

3. **Admin View**:
   - AdminPage at /admin route
   - Protected with `<ProtectedRoute adminOnly>`
   - Stats cards, data tables, toggle actions

## Page Requirements

### HomePage (/)
- Fetches data from public API (works without auth)
- Shows all items to everyone
- Conditional UI based on `isAuthenticated`:
  - Guest: Read-only + "Sign in" CTAs
  - Logged in: Same content + CRUD buttons

### LoginPage (/login)
- Username + password form
- Error display, loading state
- Redirects to / on success
- Link to register page

### RegisterPage (/register)
- Username + email + password + confirm password
- Client-side validation
- Redirects to / on success
- Link to login page

### AdminPage (/admin)
- Protected route (admin only)
- Stats cards (total, active, inactive)
- Data table with all items
- Toggle active status button

## Technical Requirements

1. **Single File**: Output ONE `App.jsx` file based on the provided skeleton.
2. **NO BrowserRouter**: main.jsx already provides it
3. **Token Storage**: localStorage.getItem/setItem('token')
4. **Structure**: Follow the provided skeleton structure EXACTLY.

## Available Packages (ONLY these)

```
react, react-dom, react-router-dom, axios, react-hot-toast,
@heroicons/react, date-fns, clsx, uuid
```

DO NOT import any other packages.

## Output Format

Generate EXACTLY ONE code block:

```jsx:App.jsx
// Complete React application based on the skeleton
// 400-600 lines of production-ready code
```

**CRITICAL:**
- Fill in the logic for the skeleton components.
- NO BrowserRouter wrapper (main.jsx provides it)
- Do NOT ask "Would you like me to continue?" - generate EVERYTHING
