# Unguarded Generation Mode - AI-Defined Architecture

This application was generated in **unguarded mode**, meaning the AI model had creative control over:

- Project structure and file organization
- Flask patterns and blueprint structure
- Authentication and security implementation
- Database schema and SQLAlchemy patterns
- API design and response format
- React component architecture and state management
- Dependency selection (within Flask/React stack)

## Fixed Constraints

The following remain constant (same as guarded mode):
- Docker containerization (backend + frontend)
- Flask backend framework
- React + Vite frontend framework
- SQLite database at `/app/data/app.db`
- Health check endpoint requirement

## Running the Application

```bash
# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up --build

# Or start individually
cd backend && python app.py
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## Research Context

This mode is designed to study AI model **architectural preferences** within the Flask/React stack,
rather than just code quality within a controlled structure. Compare with "guarded" mode apps
to see how models structure their projects when given freedom.
