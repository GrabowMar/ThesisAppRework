# Generate {{ name }} - Backend Admin Routes

{{ description }}

## Your Task
Implement the **ADMIN** backend functionality. This includes:
- Admin API routes in `routes/admin.py`
- Additional service functions in `services.py` (if needed)

The models are ALREADY DEFINED in `models.py`. Use them directly.

## Existing Models (from previous step)
{{ existing_models_summary }}

## Admin Requirements
{% for req in admin_requirements %}
- {{ req }}
{% endfor %}

{% if admin_api_endpoints %}
## Admin API Endpoints to Implement
{{ admin_api_endpoints }}
{% endif %}

## Standard Admin Patterns
Admin routes should typically provide:
1. List ALL items (including inactive/soft-deleted)
2. Toggle status (active/inactive)
3. Bulk delete operations
4. Dashboard statistics (counts, aggregates)

## Reference
{{ scaffolding_backend_context }}

## Output Format
Generate code in these markdown blocks with EXACT filenames:

**Admin Routes (required):**
```python:routes/admin.py
# Admin-only API endpoints (prefix: /api/admin/)
```

**Additional Services (if needed):**
```python:services.py
# Add to existing services file - statistics, admin helpers
```

**Extra dependencies (if needed):**
```requirements
package-name
```

Generate COMPLETE, WORKING code.
Routes MUST use `admin_bp` blueprint from `routes import admin_bp`.
Import models: `from models import db, ModelName`
