# Generate {{ name }} - Backend Admin Routes

{{ description }}

## Your Task
Implement the **ADMIN** backend functionality. This includes:
- Admin API routes in `routes/admin.py`
- Additional service functions in `services.py` (if needed)

The models are ALREADY DEFINED in `models.py`. Use them directly.

## Existing Models (from previous step)
{{ existing_models_summary }}

## Admin Requirements
{% for req in admin_requirements %}
- {{ req }}
{% endfor %}

{% if admin_api_endpoints %}
## Admin API Endpoints to Implement
{{ admin_api_endpoints }}
{% endif %}

## Standard Admin Patterns
Admin routes should typically provide:
1. List ALL items (including inactive/soft-deleted)
2. Toggle status (active/inactive)
3. Bulk delete operations
4. Dashboard statistics (counts, aggregates)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Re-defining models → ✅ use the existing models from Query 1
- ❌ Using user endpoints for admin features → ✅ use `/api/admin/...` via `admin_bp`
- ❌ Filtering admin lists by `is_active=True` → ✅ admins typically need ALL items

## Output Format
Generate code in these markdown blocks with EXACT filenames:

**Admin Routes (required):**
```python:routes/admin.py
# Admin-only API endpoints (prefix: /api/admin/)
```

**Additional Services (if needed):**
```python:services.py
# Add to existing services file - statistics, admin helpers
```

**Extra dependencies (if needed):**
```requirements
package-name
```


## Quality Checklist

Before submitting, verify:
- [x] All models have `to_dict()` methods
- [x] All routes have error handling (try/except)
- [x] All POST/PUT routes validate input
- [x] All routes use correct blueprint/decorator
- [x] All database queries use soft delete filter (`is_active=True`)
- [x] No placeholders or TODO comments
- [x] Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)


Generate COMPLETE, WORKING code. Do not include explanations.
Routes MUST use `admin_bp` blueprint from `routes import admin_bp`.
Import models: `from models import db, ModelName`
