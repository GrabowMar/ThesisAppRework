# Generate {{ name }} - Frontend Admin Page

{{ description }}

## Your Task
Implement the **ADMIN** frontend functionality. This includes:
- Admin dashboard in `pages/AdminPage.jsx`
- Admin API functions in `services/api.js` (add to existing)
- Additional admin components (if needed)

The user API functions are ALREADY DEFINED in `services/api.js`. Add admin functions to it.

## Admin Requirements
{% for req in admin_requirements %}
- {{ req }}
{% endfor %}

{% if admin_api_endpoints %}
## Admin Backend API Available
{{ admin_api_endpoints }}
{% endif %}

## Standard Admin Features
Admin page should typically include:
1. Dashboard with statistics cards
2. Table showing ALL items (including inactive)
3. Toggle buttons for status changes
4. Checkbox selection for bulk operations
5. Bulk delete button
6. Visual indicators for item status (active/inactive)

## Dependencies (Allowed)
- You MAY choose any dependencies you need.
- If you import a package that is not already in the scaffolding, include a `package.json` block in your output.
- The Dependency Healer will reconcile missing packages, but you should still list any new ones you use.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Replacing existing user API functions → ✅ only ADD admin functions
- ❌ Using user endpoints for admin actions → ✅ call `/api/admin/...`
- ❌ Forgetting inactive items → ✅ admin tables typically show ALL items

## Output Format
Generate code in these markdown blocks with EXACT filenames:

**Admin Page (required):**
```jsx:pages/AdminPage.jsx
// Admin dashboard and management interface
```

**Admin API Functions (required - ADD to existing file):**
```jsx:services/api.js
// Add these admin functions to the existing api.js file
// Keep the existing user functions, just add admin ones
```

**Dependencies (optional):**
```json:package.json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"some-lib": "^1.2.3"
	},
	"devDependencies": {
		"some-dev-lib": "^4.5.6"
	}
}
```

**Additional Admin Components (if needed):**
```jsx:components/AdminTable.jsx
// Admin-specific component
```

**Styles (if needed):**
```css
/* Additional admin styles */
```

Generate COMPLETE, WORKING code with:
- Statistics dashboard cards
- Data table with status indicators
- Bulk selection and actions
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for admin actions
- Tailwind CSS for styling

Do not include explanations—only the requested code blocks.
