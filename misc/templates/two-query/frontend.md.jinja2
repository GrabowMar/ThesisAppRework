# Generate Frontend: {{ name }}

**IMPORTANT: Generate the complete code immediately. Do not ask for confirmation or clarification. Output the full App.jsx code block directly.**

## App Requirements

### User Features
{% for req in frontend_requirements %}
- {{ req }}
{% endfor %}

### Admin Features
{% for req in admin_requirements %}
- {{ req }}
{% endfor %}

## Backend API Context

The backend has been generated with these endpoints:

{{ backend_api_context }}

## Access Control Rules

**CRITICAL - Implement conditional rendering:**

1. **Public View (Guest)**:
   - **Interactive**: Guests MUST be able to Create, Read, Update, Delete core items
   - Show "Login" button in header, but do not block main features
   - Main dashboard/list should be fully functional for guests

2. **Authenticated View (User)**:
   - Access to user profile settings
   - Potential for cloud sync or private data (if applicable)
   - Use `isAuthenticated` checks mainly for User/Admin specific pages

3. **Admin View**:
   - AdminPage at /admin route
   - Protected with `<ProtectedRoute adminOnly>`
   - Detailed system stats, user management

## UI/UX Enrichment

- **Visuals**: Use modern cards, shadows, rounded corners, and subtle animations.
- **Density**: Avoid empty space. Use badges, extensive info in list items.
- **Feedback**: Use toast notifications for every action.
- **Dashboard**: HomePage should look like a dashboard with summary stats (even for guests).

## Page Requirements

### HomePage (/)
- Fetches data from public API (works without auth)
- Shows all items to everyone
- Conditional UI based on `isAuthenticated`:
  - Guest: Read-only + "Sign in" CTAs
  - Logged in: Same content + CRUD buttons

### LoginPage (/login)
- Username + password form
- Error display, loading state
- Redirects to / on success
- Link to register page

### RegisterPage (/register)
- Username + email + password + confirm password
- Client-side validation
- Redirects to / on success
- Link to login page

### AdminPage (/admin)
- Protected route (admin only)
- Stats cards (total, active, inactive)
- Data table with all items
- Toggle active status button

## Implementation Process

Follow this structured approach:

1. **Analyze UX** → Review requirements and identify key user flows
2. **Design State** → Plan component state and API integration points
3. **Implement Components** → Build functional components with responsive UI
4. **Integrate API** → Connect frontend to backend endpoints with error handling
5. **Polish** → Add loading states, toast notifications, and empty states

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be validated against:
- ✅ UI is responsive and looks professional (modern cards, shadows)
- ✅ Forms handle validation, loading states, and error messages
- ✅ "Login" / "Register" flows work seamlessly with localStorage
- ✅ No "blank screens" on loading (use skeletons or spinners)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ `useEffect` without dependency array → Causes infinite loops
✅ Verify all dependencies in `useEffect`

❌ Hardcoded API URLs
✅ Use relative paths like `/api/...` (proxy handled by vite/nginx)

❌ Ignoring loading/error states
✅ Always show user feedback for async operations

**Why this matters:** A good frontend must be resilient to network latency and user errors.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Single File**: Output ONE `App.jsx` file based on the provided skeleton.
2. **NO BrowserRouter**: main.jsx already provides it
3. **Token Storage**: localStorage.getItem/setItem('token')
4. **Structure**: Follow the provided skeleton structure EXACTLY.
5. **Versions**: Use React 18+ (functional components, hooks) and Tailwind/CSS-in-JS constraints as implied by imports.

## Chain-of-Thought

Before generating code, mentally work through:
1. What components are needed for the dashboard/list view?
2. How will the forms likely look? What fields are needed?
3. How will I handle the auth state (login/logout)?
4. Where should I add error handling (try/catch)?

Then implement your solution addressing each point.

## Output Format

Generate EXACTLY ONE code block:

```jsx:App.jsx
// Complete React application based on the skeleton
// 400-600 lines of production-ready code
```

**CRITICAL:**
- Fill in the logic for the skeleton components.
- NO BrowserRouter wrapper (main.jsx provides it)
- Do NOT ask "Would you like me to continue?" - generate EVERYTHING
