# Generate {{ name }} - Frontend

{{ description }}

## YOUR MISSION
Generate **complete, runnable** React frontend code that satisfies ALL requirements and integrates with the provided backend API.

## Stack & Versions
- React 18
- Axios (use the provided axios instance pattern)
- Tailwind CSS + react-hot-toast

## Dependencies (Allowed)
- You MAY choose any additional frontend dependencies.
- If you import a package that is not already in the scaffolding, include a `package.json` block in your output.
- The Dependency Healer will reconcile missing packages, but you should still list any new ones you use.

## Requirements
{% for req in frontend_requirements %}
- {{ req }}
{% endfor %}

{% if api_endpoints %}
## Backend API Available
{{ api_endpoints }}
{% endif %}

## Implementation Process (DO INTERNALLY)
1. Map requirements → UI sections, state, and user flows.
2. Map endpoints → functions in `services/api.js` (axios baseURL is `/api` by default; honors `VITE_BACKEND_URL` when set).
3. Implement loading/error/empty states and optimistic UX where safe.
4. Add toast notifications for create/update/delete actions.
5. Sanity-check: no placeholders/TODOs/truncated code.

## Reference
{{ scaffolding_frontend_context }}

## Output Format
Wrap each file in markdown code blocks:
- `jsx` → becomes App.jsx
- `jsx:components/Name.jsx` → additional component
- `css` → becomes App.css
- `json:package.json` → optional dependencies to merge

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All requirements implemented
- ✅ API integration matches endpoints + response shapes
- ✅ Good UX (loading/errors/toasts)
- ✅ No placeholders/TODOs

Generate complete, working code with good UX (loading, errors, toasts). Do not include explanations.
