# Analysis System - Now Working! ✅

## Issue Resolution
**Problem**: The analysis overview page was showing "Page Not Found" 
**Root Cause**: 
1. Route was only mapped to `/analysis/` but user was accessing `/analysis/overview`
2. Template reference was pointing to wrong file name

**Solution Applied**:
1. ✅ **Added dual route mapping**: Now both `/analysis/` and `/analysis/overview` work
2. ✅ **Fixed template reference**: Updated to use `analysis_overview_improved.html`
3. ✅ **Flask auto-reload**: Changes applied automatically
