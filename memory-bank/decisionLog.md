# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-07-28 | Integrated comprehensive JavaScript frontend security and quality analysis tools via npx | The thesis research analyzes 900+ AI-generated applications with React frontends. By integrating retire.js, enhanced Snyk, JSHint, Prettier, and security-focused ESLint configurations, we can now detect JavaScript vulnerabilities, vulnerable dependencies, code quality issues, and formatting problems. Using npx ensures tools are available without complex installation requirements. Separate security vs quality analysis allows for targeted insights. This significantly enhances the frontend analysis capabilities needed for comprehensive AI application security research. |
