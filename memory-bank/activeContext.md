# Active Context

## Current Goals

- Successfully improved logging across the entire Thesis Research App with comprehensive enhancements:
- ## Completed Logging Improvements:
- ### 1. Enhanced Application Factory (app.py)
- - Integrated centralized LoggingService from core_services
- - Added fallback logging with request correlation IDs
- - Implemented rotating file handlers (app.log, errors.log, requests.log)
- - Added performance tracking with timing middleware
- - Created context filters for request correlation and component identification
- ### 2. Advanced Core Services Logging (core_services.py)
- - Enhanced BaseService class with operation tracking and performance metrics
- - Added _safe_execute() method for comprehensive operation logging
- - Implemented cache statistics and hit/miss tracking in CacheableService
- - Added service uptime and operation counters
- - Created structured logging with component identification
- ### 3. Enhanced Web Routes (web_routes.py)
- - Added performance logging decorator (@log_performance)
- - Enhanced ResponseHandler with timing and error tracking
- - Improved error responses with request correlation IDs
- - Added detailed logging to dashboard and critical routes
- - Implemented comprehensive error context logging
- ### 4. Batch Service Logging (batch_testing_service.py)
- - Added operation creation timing and metrics
- - Enhanced error handling with performance tracking
- - Improved container operation logging with detailed context
- - Added comprehensive status tracking and logging
- ### 5. Advanced Logging Configuration (logging_config.py)
- - Created comprehensive logging setup with multiple handlers
- - Implemented specialized filters (performance, sensitive data)
- - Added JSON structured logging for analytics
- - Created rotating handlers with appropriate size limits
- - Added third-party logger configuration
- ### 6. Updated AI Instructions (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
- - Added comprehensive logging architecture section
- - Documented request correlation patterns
- - Added logging best practices and usage patterns
- - Included service initialization and error handling patterns
- ## Current Status:
- - Application running successfully with enhanced logging
- - All services properly initialized with detailed logging
- - Request correlation working (8-character UUIDs)
- - Performance tracking active (timing in milliseconds)
- - Component identification working (service.module format)
- - Error handling comprehensive with full context
- The enhanced logging system provides complete visibility into application operations, performance metrics, and error tracking while maintaining high performance.
