## Current Goals

- Successfully integrated comprehensive JavaScript frontend security and quality analysis tools into the thesis research application. The system now supports 5 frontend security tools (retire.js, Snyk, JSHint, ESLint security, npm-audit) and 3 quality tools (Prettier, ESLint quality, JSHint quality). All tools work via npx and have standardized output parsing. The FrontendSecurityAnalyzer and FrontendQualityAnalyzer classes are fully functional and integrated with the UnifiedCLIAnalyzer for comprehensive analysis of AI-generated React applications. Ready to analyze the 900+ generated applications for JavaScript vulnerabilities, dependency issues, and code quality problems as part of the AI model comparison research.
