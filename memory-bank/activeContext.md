## Current Goals

- Successfully completed file consolidation and route updates for unified security testing platform. Removed 4 redundant HTML template files (enhanced_security_testing.html, comprehensive_security_testing.html, enhanced_batch_testing.html, batch_testing.html) and updated all navigation and route references to point to the new unified_security_testing.html template via testing.testing_dashboard route. Updated base.html navigation from "Container Operations" to "Security Testing" with proper routing and icon changes. The platform now uses a single, comprehensive security testing interface with container management controls.
