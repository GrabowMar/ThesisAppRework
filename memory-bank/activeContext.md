## Current Goals

- Successfully modernized Flask routes system from obsolete code to HTMX-powered interactive application. Created working minimal version with Bootstrap 5.3.0 UI, proper navigation, and stub functionality for all major features. Flask app running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 with responsive sidebar navigation and HTMX partial page updates. Next step is to gradually integrate the existing analysis services from main.py when dependencies are properly configured.
